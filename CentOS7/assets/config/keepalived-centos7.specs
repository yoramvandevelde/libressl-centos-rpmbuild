%description 
The main goal of the keepalived project is to add a strong & robust keepalive facility to the Linux Virtual Server project. It implements a multilayer TCP/IP stack checks. Keepalived implements a framework based on three family checks : Layer3, Layer4 & Layer5. This framework gives the daemon the ability of checking a LVS server pool states. Keepalived can be sumarize as a LVS driving daemon.

Keepalived implementation is based on an I/O multiplexer to handle a strong multi-threading framework. All the events process use this I/O multiplexer.
